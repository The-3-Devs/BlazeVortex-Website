        <br />
        <p>
          <strong>Last updated:</strong> April 25, 2025
        </p>
        <h2 className="mt-4 text-2xl">1. Acceptance of Terms</h2>
        <p>
          By interacting with BlazeVortex, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
          We might change them whenever, and if you keep using the bot after
          that, you’re agreeing to the new stuff too.
        </p>
        <h2 className="mt-4 text-2xl">2. Bot Usage</h2>
        <p>
          BlazeVortex is meant to be used on Discord servers or DMs. You agree
          not to:
          <br />- Spam the bot
          <br />- Abuse, harass, or misuse commands
          <br />- Attempt to exploit or break the bot
          <br />- Use BlazeVortex to do anything illegal, stupid, or against
          Discord’s own ToS
          <br />
          <br />
          If you break the rules, we can block you, ban the bot from your
          server, or straight-up blacklist your user ID.
        </p>
        <h2 className="mt-4 text-2xl">3. Command Behavior</h2>
        <p>
          BlazeVortex includes various commands, including AI-generated
          responses, moderation tools, and other interactive features. You agree
          that:
          <br />- Youre responsible for how you use those commands
          <br />- AI replies might be sarcastic, offensive, or wild — and that’s
          intentional
          <br />- You won’t sue us because BlazeVortex roasted you
        </p>
        <h2 className="mt-4 text-2xl">4. Content Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>
          BlazeVortex responds to messages. Sometimes it’s funny. Sometimes it’s
          mean. Sometimes it just goes rogue (blame Gemini). You acknowledge
          that:
          <br />- Responses may not always be accurate, serious, or appropriate
          <br />- You should use common sense before reacting to anything the
          bot says
          <br />- We’re not responsible for what users do with the bot in their
          servers
        </p>
        <h2 className="mt-4 text-2xl">5. Availability</h2>
        <p>
          BlazeVortex is provided “as is” — no guarantees of uptime, bug-free
          performance, or feature stability. It might crash, reboot, or ghost
          you mid-convo. That’s life.
          <br />
          We may:
          <br />- Take the bot offline for updates or maintenance
          <br />- Shut it down forever if we get bored or sued
          <br />- Change features without notice
        </p>
        <h2 className="mt-4 text-2xl">6. Termination</h2>
        <p>
          We reserve the right to:
          <br />- Block any user or server from using the bot
          <br />- Revoke access at any time for any reason
          <br />- Nuke the bot from orbit if necessary
        </p>
        <h2 className="mt-4 text-2xl">7. Data and Privacy</h2>
        <p>
          Refer to our Privacy Policy (right below) for what we collect and how
          we use it. Short version: we don’t hoard your data or do creepy stuff.
          But you still agree to let us process what little we do collect.
        </p>
        <h2 className="mt-4 text-2xl">8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
          We’re not responsible for:
          <br />- Any damages caused by the bot
          <br />- Any dumb shit you do using the bot
          <br />- Any server drama caused by BlazeVortex roasting your mods
          <br />
          <br />
          The bot is entertainment. Don’t treat it like gospel.
        </p>
        <h2 className="mt-4 text-2xl">9. AI Behavior Clause</h2>
        <p>
          BlazeVortex includes AI-based features (e.g., `!ai` or `~ai`), powered
          by large language models. You acknowledge:
          <br />- AI replies are not human-curated
          <br />- Responses can be wild, unfiltered, edgy, or just plain wrong
          <br />- We can’t control everything the AI says — so use at your own
          risk
        </p>
        <h2 className="mt-4 text-2xl">10. Feedback</h2>
        <p>
          Got suggestions? Bugs? Feature requests? Roast material? We accept all
          that via our support Discord server or command `!feedback`.
          <br />
          If you send us an idea and we implement it, you don’t get ownership or
          royalties. You just get bragging rights.
        </p>
        <h2 className="mt-4 text-2xl">11. Final Word</h2>
        <p>
          These Terms are the whole deal. If you don’t like them, don’t use
          BlazeVortex. If you do use it, then hey — welcome to the vortex. Try
          not to get ratio’d by the bot.
        </p>
        <h2 className="mt-4 text-2xl">12. Contact</h2>
        <p>
          If you need to reach us, complain, or send fan art:
          <br />- Join our official support Discord server
          <br />- Use bot commands like `!help`, `!support`, or `!contact`
          <br />- DM any of The 3 Devs (T3D), we’re probably lurking somewhere
        </p>
        <h2 className="mt-4 text-2xl">13. TL;DR</h2>
        <p>
          Don’t be a jackass, don’t abuse the bot, don’t sue us. BlazeVortex is
          here to roast, help, and vibe. Use it at your own risk — and enjoy the
          chaos responsibly.
